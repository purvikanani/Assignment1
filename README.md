## Task
We are predicting the parameters Para-9, Para-10, Para-11, Para-12, and Para-13 for year 10 from a 10-year dataset from an IoT sensor on the road.

## Model Used
We have used 
<ul>Bayesian Ridge</ul>
<ul>Kernal Ridge</ul>
<ul>Gradient Boosting</ul>
for solving this problem.

## Results
The RMSE value of models are:-
<ol>Bayesian Ridge    --> 77.04498657347912</ol>
<ol>Kernal Ridge      --> 106.81986414973701</ol>
<ol>Gradient Boosting --> 38.20427011859272</ol>

## RMSE value of best model is 38.204 by Gradient Boosting
